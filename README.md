# Postman to k6 GitHub Action

A reusable GitHub Action that automatically converts Postman collections to k6 load testing scripts and executes them with configurable load profiles (smoke, load, stress, spike) on different runners.

## Features

- 🔄 **Runtime Conversion**: Automatically converts Postman collections to k6 scripts at runtime
- 📊 **Load Profiles**: Pre-configured load profiles (smoke, load, stress, spike) with customizable thresholds
- 🚀 **Distributed Execution**: Run different load profiles on different GitHub Actions runners
- ⚙️ **Flexible Configuration**: Customize load profiles via YAML configuration
- 📦 **Reusable**: Use as a composite action in any GitHub repository
- 🔍 **Comprehensive Reporting**: Automatic artifact upload and test results

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Load Testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  load-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run Postman to k6 Load Test
        uses: your-org/postman-to-k6-action@v1
        with:
          postman-collection: 'postman/collection.json'
          load-profile: 'smoke'
```

### Running Multiple Profiles

```yaml
name: Load Testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  load-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        profile: [smoke, load, stress, spike]
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run Postman to k6 Load Test
        uses: your-org/postman-to-k6-action@v1
        with:
          postman-collection: 'postman/collection.json'
          load-profile: ${{ matrix.profile }}
```

## Load Profiles

### Smoke Test

Quick validation test to verify basic functionality.

- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Virtual Users**: 1-5
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback on system availability

### Load Test

Test system under expected normal load conditions.

- **Duration**: ~9 minutes
- **Virtual Users**: 10-50 (gradual ramp-up)
- **Purpose**: Validate performance under normal conditions

### Stress Test

Test system limits and breaking points.

- **Duration**: ~15 minutes
- **Virtual Users**: 50-200 (progressive increase)
- **Purpose**: Identify maximum capacity and failure points

### Spike Test

Simulate sudden traffic surge to test system resilience.

- **Duration**: ~3 minutes
- **Virtual Users**: 10-100 (rapid spike)
- **Purpose**: Test system behavior under sudden load changes

## Configuration

### Custom Load Profiles

You can customize load profiles by creating a `profiles/load-profiles.yaml` file:

```yaml
profiles:
  custom-profile:
    name: "Custom Load Profile"
    description: "My custom load profile"
    stages:
      - duration: "2m"
        target: 20
        rampUp: "30s"
      - duration: "5m"
        target: 20
      - duration: "1m"
        target: 0
        rampDown: "30s"
    thresholds:
      http_req_duration: ["p(95)<2000"]
      http_req_failed: ["rate<0.01"]
```

### Stage Configuration

Each stage can have:

- `duration`: Test duration (e.g., "1m", "30s", "5m")
- `target`: Target number of virtual users
- `rampUp`: Optional ramp-up time
- `rampDown`: Optional ramp-down time

### Thresholds

Define pass/fail criteria for your tests:

- `http_req_duration`: Response time thresholds (e.g., `["p(95)<2000"]`)
- `http_req_failed`: Error rate thresholds (e.g., `["rate<0.01"]`)
- `iteration_duration`: Total iteration time thresholds

## Advanced Usage

### Using Postman Environment Files

```yaml
- name: Run Postman to k6 Load Test
  uses: your-org/postman-to-k6-action@v1
  with:
    postman-collection: 'postman/collection.json'
    environment-file: 'postman/environment.json'
    load-profile: 'load'
```

### Custom k6 Options

```yaml
- name: Run Postman to k6 Load Test
  uses: your-org/postman-to-k6-action@v1
  with:
    postman-collection: 'postman/collection.json'
    load-profile: 'stress'
    k6-options: '--out json=results.json --summary-export=summary.json'
```

### Different Runners for Different Profiles

```yaml
jobs:
  load-test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - profile: smoke
            runner: ubuntu-latest
          - profile: load
            runner: self-hosted
          - profile: stress
            runner: [self-hosted, high-memory]
          - profile: spike
            runner: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run Postman to k6 Load Test
        uses: your-org/postman-to-k6-action@v1
        with:
          postman-collection: 'postman/collection.json'
          load-profile: ${{ matrix.profile }}
          runner-label: ${{ matrix.runner }}
```

## How It Works

1. **Validation**: Validates the Postman collection JSON file
2. **Conversion**: Uses `@apideck/postman-to-k6` to convert the collection to a k6 script
3. **Profile Configuration**: Loads the specified load profile from YAML configuration
4. **Options Injection**: Merges load profile options (stages, thresholds) into the k6 script
5. **Execution**: Runs k6 with the configured load profile
6. **Artifacts**: Uploads test results and generated scripts as artifacts

## Requirements

- Postman collection exported as JSON (v2.1 format)
- Node.js 18+ (for conversion tool)
- k6 installed (handled automatically by the action)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Smoke Tests**: Always run smoke tests first to validate basic functionality
2. **Gradual Load Increase**: Use proper ramp-up times to avoid overwhelming your system
3. **Set Realistic Thresholds**: Base thresholds on actual SLA requirements
4. **Monitor Resources**: Watch system resources during stress tests
5. **Test in Isolation**: Run load tests in dedicated environments when possible
6. **Document Your Profiles**: Keep load profile configurations documented and version-controlled

## Troubleshooting

### Collection Not Found

Ensure the path to your Postman collection is correct relative to the repository root:

```yaml
postman-collection: 'path/to/collection.json'  # ✅ Correct
postman-collection: './collection.json'        # ✅ Also correct
postman-collection: 'collection.json'          # ✅ Also correct
```

### Profile Not Found

If you see "Profile not found" warnings:

1. Check that the profile name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify your `profiles-config` path points to the correct file
3. Ensure the profile is defined in your YAML configuration

### k6 Execution Fails

- Check that your Postman collection is valid JSON
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Review k6 logs in the workflow output
- Ensure your API endpoints are accessible from the GitHub Actions runner
